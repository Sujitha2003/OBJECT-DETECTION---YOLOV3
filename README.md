# OBJECT-DETECTION---YOLOV3
Hey guys,so here I tried object detection using yolov3 in my last repository I tried binary classification using CNN and there the input image has only one object in it.But what if a single image contains more than one objects,in such cases a pretrained model named YOLO(you only look once) can be use.
